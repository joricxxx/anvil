# Anvil
  A website that provides an online platform for selling and redistributing surplus food. It connects sellers—such as small food businesses, bakeries, restaurants, and home-based sellers—with nearby buyers who want affordable food options, helping reduce the amount of edible food that goes to waste.   
    
  Through listings, photos, pickup details, and real-time availability updates, sellers can quickly post unsold items and buyers can easily browse what’s available around them. By making surplus food more accessible and easier to purchase, the platform supports both cost savings for buyers and additional income for sellers, while promoting a more sustainable and responsible way of consuming food.
